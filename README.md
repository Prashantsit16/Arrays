# Arrays
AIM:
This repository contains study and implementation of arrays in C++ programming.

Theory:
An array is a collection of elements, all of the same type, stored in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value. Each element in an array is stored at a specific index, making it easy to access and manipulate the data.

Basic syntax of array :
array_name [ size of array]

Types of arrays:
1. One- Dimensional array:
 It stores element in a single row or column. It can have one row and many columns or one column and many rows. Also known as 'linear array' it is the simplest form of array.
 #### Syntax: array_name[size_of_array]= { array_elements}
2. Two- Dimensional array:
Two-dimensional arrays store data in a grid format with rows and columns. It can have manu rows and mamny columns. Each element is accessed by two indices: one for the row and one for the column. It is also known as matrix.
Syntax: array_name [size_of_rows] [size_of_column] = { array elements}
3. Multi dimensional array:
These are arrays with more than two dimensions. They can be thought of as arrays of arrays, where each dimension adds another level of indexing.
Indexing :
Indexing in arrays refers to the way elements in an array are accessed using their position, known as an index. Array indexing starts at 0. This means the first element of an array is accessed with index 0, the second element with index 1, and so on. In multi-dimensional arrays, you use multiple indices to access an element, one for each dimension.

length() function: This function is an inbuilt function used to find the length of array
The length of the function is always equal to one less than that of index.

Conclusion:
We learnt about arrays and it's implementation.
